    <h2 class="mume-header" id="kreaturentypen">Creature Types</h2>
    <div class="row-section">
        <div class="col sixty">
            <p>Peculiarities of creature types are now automatically included in dependent rolls. This includes poison, disease and spell immunity, damage modifiers through blessed and magical weapons (see Enhancements for weapon domains), spell resistance
                and immunities to conditions. The creature type is defined through the Creature Type field on creatures. This is only available for the creature sheet. For example, for demons the damage for mundane weapons is automatically halved.

    <div class="row-section">
        <div class="col sixty">
            <p>Equipment, armor and weapons now have a "Domain" field which allows you to give the item additional custom attributes. Two of those attributes work in combination with the new feature "creature types". Use the attributes "blessed" or "magical"
                to enable this function. You can also use the things like "blessed (Tsa)" to define by what deity this weapon has been blessed. This has some extra effects on certain creature types (e.g. against golems). (This is also the place for possible
                future attributes).</p>

            <p>In the preparation for Aventurian Armory 2 (Module is not required for this) effects for ammunitions have been added. This allows to create ammunition with bonus effects like more damage, burning condition and so on.</p>

    <div class="row-section">
        <div class="col sixty">
            <p>The master's menu now allows to sort (drag & drop), remove, and add more actors (drag & drop) to the tracked list. By default, this list includes all actors which had a player connected at the first start of the master's menu. You can now
                add more actors (also antagonists, creatures etc.), which should be helpful for accessing important opponents and friends at all times. You can also remove characters which are not in use anymore.</p>

    <h1 class="mume-header" id="erweiterungen">Enhancements</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>Merchants won&apos;t sell their underpants anymore (equipment which is &quot;worn&quot; will not be shown in the merchants trading inventory)</li>
        <li>Adventure initializing has now a pending indicator, so you don&#x2019;t click too fast and mess up your world</li>
        <li>Adventure initializing now creates subfolders for actors depending on their first appearance in an adventure</li>
        <li>Adventure initializing can now be invoked again to update actors, journals and scenes. Beware! This can reset some manual changes.</li>
        <li>Creatures learned to learn languages. Talking horses are a go!</li>
        <li>Regeneration rolls now show a check mark, if applied through the chat context menu</li>
        <li>Damaged weapons and armors now gain the proper malus for attacks and defenses. The TDE Foundry does not use damage steps. Instead, every 25% of missing structure points automatically adds one step of &quot;damaged&quot;. Features to quickly apply
            structure point damage will be added in a future patch. You can enable this function in the system settings. Make sure to give every weapon and armor that should be able to be damaged a structure value which is dividable by 4. Roll checks
            will appear automatically in the chat and can be invoked manually on the item sheet.
        </li>
        <li>The name of enemies can now be obfuscated through an alias in the chat and combat tracker</li>
        <li>Spending or refunding adventure points now shows a notification for a brief moment</li>
        <li>The armor sheet now stores armory sub categories. This is necessary for breaking point ratings and will enable to add modifiers which are dependent on the worn armor (like arrows which ignore chain mail armor)</li>
    </ul>
