      </h2>

      <p>You can now create a special item called &quot;Effect container&quot;. The sole purpose of this item is to store
        Active Effects since Foundry doesn&apos;t provide a default option to do so. You can add several Active Effects to
        this item. Those effects are copied to an actor on drag and drop, useful for frequently used effects. This workaround
        might be removed in the future once Foundry has a better base implementation of this function.</p>

      <h2 class="mume-header" id="journalbrowser-verbesserungen">Group fate points</h2>

      <p>The master&apos;s menu now contains group fate points. Those can be used like normal fatepoints via the chat context
        menu. You have to remove fatepoints which you intend to use for the pool from actors manually. You can do so by adding
        a negative modifier to the fatepoint max value on the character sheet (this cannot automatically be tracked, since the
        tool is not aware which characters are adding points to the pool).</p>

      <h2 class="mume-header" id="journalbrowser-verbesserungen">Weapon poisoning &amp; Talisman</h2>

    <p>You can now poison your melee weapon. To do so drag and drop a poison on the opened item sheet of a melee weapon. On
      a successfull attack a button in the chat will appear to execute the poison check. Each time you roll the poison
      check, a charge of the poison will be removed. Set the permanent option if you don&apos;t want to deduce charges of
      poison on usage (for example for enemy creatures or special weapons).<br>
      Also creating talismans is now available in the same fashion as enchantments. The only difference is that they never
      deplete if set to permanent and don&apos;t need to recharge.</p>

  <h1 class="mume-header" id="verbesserungen">Enhancements</h1>

  <ul>
    <li>The parry value of weapons is now calculated through the primary attribute of the weapon instead of the combat
      skill. You can now create special weapons with for example sagacity as a primary attribute.</li>
    <li>Applying damage via the chat context menu now leaves a small indicator to remind the gamemaster that it has already
      been applied.</li>
    <li>Actor flags are not wiped anymore during actor creation to support 3rd party modules better.</li>
    <li>Missing initialization text for adventures should now be shown again properly.</li>
    <li>Dices can now be configured with individual Dice so Nice color sets in the configuration menu.</li>
    <li>The optional rule &quot;less regeneration&quot; can now be enabled via configuration.</li>
    <li>The journal browser now features a small arrow button to hide the table of contents. This can improve readability of
      large text blocks.</li>
    <li>You can now add permanent and temporary modifiers to the regeneration roll for all affected ressources. To do so
      find your LP configuration on the attributes/special abilities part of the character sheet and click on the name. This
      will expand the corresponding menu. ATTENTION: Temporary modifiers will be wiped on the next regeneration roll.</li>
    <li>ActiveEffects can now modify groups of skill checks (e.g. liturgical chants, spells).</li>
    <li>Normal rolls via chat commands now have a context options to apply damage (e.g. whenever a player gets randomly
      struck by thunder and you want to add damage to the player via chat).</li>
    <li>The combat reaction dialog has been optimized to reduce required amounts of clicks by one. Your mouse-hand will
      thank you.</li>
    <li>Spells do now track the casting time in the character sheet and the combat tracker.</li>
    <li>The token bar will now always show at least one spell in combat (if the actor is a blessed one or mage). This button
      can expand to a submenu showing all spells. So you have access to spells that are not solely intended for damage (e.g.
      Axxeleratus).</li>
    <li>The conditions Bleeding &amp; Burning now apply damage on each round automatically (during combat only!).</li>
    <li>The master menu can now apply a default vision modifier to combat rolls depending on the darkness level of the scene
      (darksight is included in the calculation automatically).</li>
    <li>The merchant sheet has now an option for a basic character sheet for epic and legendary heros (like a king or your
      spouse), which don&apos;t really have stats and only require a picture and some background information. This is not
      yet a fully fledged feature and will probably grow.</li>
    <li>A short &quot;Did you know?&quot; message after loading was added to help players use this system a little better.
    </li>

  </ul>
  <h1 class="mume-header" id="bugfixes">Bugfixes</h1>

  <ul>
    <li>Item sets should be working properly again (/packages) (requires the next core module update!).</li>
    <li>The expand modifier list for rolls option should now be working as intended.</li>
    <li>Gear should now remain in containers during migrations.</li>
    <li>Native language added during character generation have their adventure point values now reduced to zero. This
      results in a proper calculation of the free language points included in careers.</li>
    <li>Fixed a minor issue with the depiction of the Dice so Nice configuration menu.</li>
    <li>Combat spells should now apply the correct -4 modifier to dodge.</li>

  </ul>


  <h1 class="mume-header" id="patch-221">Patch 2.2.1</h1>

  <h2 class="mume-header" id="verbesserungen-1">Enhancements</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Cumulative group check is now more advanced.</li>
    <li>Introduced a new notes field for owner of the sheet (f.e. to hide character background from fellow players).</li>
    <li>Webm Tokens should now be properly visible in the chat.</li>
    <li>The dodge value can now be toggled to defense instead for creatures. This means that the modifier from multiple
      defenses does not apply anymore for that creature. We are going to update existing creatures at a later point.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 class="mume-header" id="bugs-1">Bugs</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Reroll damage through a fate point for spells should now work again.</li>
    <li>Dropping professions with attribute requirements on a npc actor should now properly show the modified attribute
      values.</li>
    <li>The Special Ability improve attack should now work properly.</li>
    <li>Tricks and trainings for animal companions should be transferable to the creatures (missing active effects still
      require an update of the companion module at a later point)</li>
    <li>The function of property knowledge and focus shouldn&apos;t be switched anymore.</li>
  </ul>
