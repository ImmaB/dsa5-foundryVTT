                This patch does not provide a lot of new features (there were already plenty last month). Instead the focus is on stability and bugfixes because the next version of Foundry is almost finished. We will now focus on the required changes for the update.
                Please refrain from using TDE 2.5.0 with Foundry 9 because it is not yet compatible. We'll provide a beta soon and with the arrival of the beta support and updates for Foundry 0.8 and TDE will stop.

                The core module now contains a calculator which can be used to assist in the character generation. It sums up Adventure Point costs of several character elements and attribute sums dependent on character experience and similar things. You can find it
                by typing /cc in the chat or using the macro in the core macros compendium. Drag your actor onto the calculator to see your AP costs (Players need to drag the token link next to the name on their character sheet). Please refrain from reporting
                any tickets concerning character generation or this tool. We do not plan to deal with the pandora's box of character generation. Tickets will be ignored, cut into four, drowned and redirected to the nameless one.
