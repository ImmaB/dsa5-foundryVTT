                VTTom enlarged his collection of useful tutorial videos again in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgVzSn5NkMaO-PDxhCiAAjA" target="_blank">channel</a>. Many of those include english subtitles.
                </br>
                Also he invested again some effort to provide the patchnotes as video. Fortunately again already also with subtitles by Nellkir!

                The upcoming "Masters Toolbox" module will include a sophisticated NPC generator to create random encounters in a matter of seconds. This generator provides options to randomly select attributes, special abilities, spells, equipment, token images and
                many more. Moreover, the module includes a name generator with all syllables available in the Aventurian Book of Names (some 17400 syllables, creating an endless number of possibilities) which can be used separately or in combination with
                the generator. Also included is a generator for loot and taverns. The loot generator is based on some of the tables of the book "Aventurische Meisterschaft" (As an added bonus new images for lootable gems have been created) and allows
                to put the loot directly on the canvas (as a loot sheet). The tavern generator is based on the supplement "Inns and Taverns" and includes some taverns, bar fight special abilities and most importantly: a lot of alcoholic beverages required
                for every tavern (Thanks to Nellkir and VTTom for their support and work on the tavern stuff).

    <h2>Aventurian Armory 2 (German only)</h2>

            <p>
                The upcoming module Aventurian Armory 2 allows you to enable armor hitzones for players and NPC characters (Creatures are not supported). To enable this focus rule you also need to enable the rule for hitzones (which is part of the compendium module).
                This feature enables fields for hitzones both on the character sheet and the armor sheet. Encumbrance is calculated automatically, but you might want to have a look at the INI and MOV modifiers. Existing armors will not be updated for
                this feature (most people probably don't include a helmet by default anyways and we would have to decide which armor provides protection on which zones...). They will only provide armor for the chest, so you have to change armor values
                manually depending on your choice. You can also access a weight calculator for armor by clicking on the weight label in the armor sheet, so you can recalculate the weight of your leather armor if you remove one arm for example. </p>
